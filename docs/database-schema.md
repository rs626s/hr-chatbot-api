# Database Schema – HR Chatbot API

## Overview

The HR Chatbot system uses a relational database managed by **Spring Data JPA / Hibernate**.

Database used:
- Local development: H2  
- Production: PostgreSQL  

Tables are generated automatically from JPA entities.

# Tables

## 1. users

Stores registered users.

| Column | Type | Constraints |
|--------|--------|--------|
| id | BIGINT | Primary Key, Auto Increment |
| username | VARCHAR(50) | Unique, Not Null |
| email | VARCHAR(100) | Unique, Not Null |
| password_hash | VARCHAR(255) | Not Null |
| first_name | VARCHAR(50) | Nullable |
| last_name | VARCHAR(50) | Nullable |
| role | VARCHAR(20) | Not Null, Default = USER |
| enabled | BOOLEAN | Not Null, Default = TRUE |
| created_at | TIMESTAMP | Not Null, Auto Generated |
| updated_at | TIMESTAMP | Auto Updated |
| last_login | TIMESTAMP | Nullable |

### Relationships
- One user can have multiple conversations.
- Cascade: ALL (deleting a user deletes conversations).

---

## 2. conversations

Stores conversation sessions.

| Column | Type | Constraints |
|--------|--------|--------|
| id | BIGINT | Primary Key, Auto Increment |
| title | VARCHAR(200) | Nullable |
| created_at | TIMESTAMP | Not Null, Auto Generated |
| updated_at | TIMESTAMP | Auto Updated |
| user_id | BIGINT | Foreign Key → users.id, Not Null |

### Relationships
- Many conversations belong to one user.
- One conversation has many messages.
- Cascade to messages: ALL.

---

## 3. messages

Stores chat messages.

| Column | Type | Constraints |
|--------|--------|--------|
| id | BIGINT | Primary Key, Auto Increment |
| content | TEXT | Not Null |
| role | VARCHAR(20) | Not Null ("USER" or "ASSISTANT") |
| created_at | TIMESTAMP | Not Null, Auto Generated |
| conversation_id | BIGINT | Foreign Key → conversations.id, Not Null |

### Relationships
- Many messages belong to one conversation.

# JPA Mapping Notes

User to Conversation  
One user can have many conversations. Cascade operations ensure conversations are removed if the user is deleted.

Conversation to Message  
One conversation can have many messages. Cascade operations ensure messages are removed if the conversation is deleted.

Fetch Type  
LAZY loading is used for relationships to improve performance.

---

# Hibernate Features Used

- @CreationTimestamp automatically sets creation time.
- @UpdateTimestamp automatically updates modification time.
- Cascade operations maintain referential integrity.

---

# Indexing Recommendations (Next Sprint)

Suggested indexes:
- users(username)
- users(email)
- conversations(user_id)
- messages(conversation_id)

---

# Notes

- Passwords are stored as hashed values (BCrypt).
- Role field controls authorization (USER / ADMIN).
- H2 database is used for development.
- PostgreSQL will be used in production.
- Schema is automatically managed by Hibernate from entity definitions.
